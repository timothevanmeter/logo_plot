Increasing the size of the font means increasing its width, so the visual representation is less convincing because each position in the sequence do not occupy the same horizontal space in the representation...
Trying to get a way to scale down the width of the letter so it is constant for all positions in the sequence. But doing this using the cairo library might be challenging.
